# Configure Swift Mailer

> **Replaced by:** [**Symfony Mailer**](https://www.drupal.org/project/symfony\_mailer)****
>
> A new mail-system based on the popular Symfony Mailer giving full support of HTML mails, file attachments, embedded images, 3rd-party delivery integrations, load-balancing/failover, signing/encryption, async sending and more. Other libraries add capability for CSS inlining and HTML to text conversion.
>
> This module provides a deep integration into Drupal mechanisms, including theme/template/render, multi-language, CSS libraries, configuration, plug-ins, hooks, and logging.
>
>
>
> _**Warning**_**:** the swiftmailer library is no longer maintained and so this module is obsolete. It has not yet been marked unsupported, but that could change at any time due to discovery of a security bug or on advice of the Drupal Security Team.
>
> A new module [Symfony Mailer](https://www.drupal.org/project/symfony\_mailer) is under development, and has a reasonable alpha release. Help with testing or development is welcome.
