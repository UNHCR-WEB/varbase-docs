# Understanding Varbase Updater Package

The Varbase Updater \([varbase-updater](https://github.com/Vardot/varbase-updater)\) package was made to make updating Varbase as easy as possible. It's a set of scripts and tools that will help you to update to the newer versions of Varbase.

## Installing Varbase Updater

Varbase Updater comes pre-installed with Varbase if you install Varbase through the Composer-based project template [varbase-project](https://github.com/Vardot/varbase-project). 

However, if you're using Varbase 8.6.2 and older, you will have to manually add the package by running this command: `composer require vardot/varbase-updater`



## Varbase Updater Process

Varbase Updater process is outlined in the rudimentary flowchart below:

![](../.gitbook/assets/varbase-updater-flowchart.png)

The process relies on a configuration file that is used as rules for updating from one version to another. The configuration file can be found in `config/update-config.json` and is described as below:

* `“composer-project-json-url”`: the composer.json file that will be used in as the new file to process the update.
* Each version pattern is treated as the detected version to be updated, and is defined in the JSON file with its own rules which are:
  * `“from”`: is the detected version.
  * `“to”`: is the target limit version to upgrade to.
  * `“packages”`: can include:
    * `“crucial”`: determines the packages that must be required/re-downloaded even if the target version no longer requires them.
    * `“skip”`: determines the packages that won’t be updated and remain on its old version.
  * `“enable-after-update”`: defines the modules will be enabled after the code update, and before the `drush updatedb` command.

{% hint style="info" %}
At the end of the update process, two log files are useful to troubleshoot your update:

* `varbase_update_error.log`: a log of all errors that occurred during the update process.
* `varbase_failed_patches.log`: a log of all patches that failed to apply during the update process.
