# Understanding Varbase Updater Package

The Varbase Updater \([varbase-updater](https://github.com/Vardot/varbase-updater)\) package was made to make updating Varbase as easy as possible. It's a set of scripts and tools that will help you to update to the newer versions of Varbase.

## Installing Varbase Updater

Varbase Updater comes pre-installed with Varbase if you install Varbase through the Composer-based project template [varbase-project](https://github.com/Vardot/varbase-project). 

However, if you're using Varbase 8.6.2 and older, you will have to manually add the package through running this command: `composer require Vardot/varbase-updater`



## Varbase Updater Process

@todo: document the process.
