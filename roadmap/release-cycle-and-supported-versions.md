# Release Cycle and Supported Versions

## Understanding Version Numbers

Varbase follows the Drupal 8/9 release cycle. Therefore, a version of Varbase that is named 8.x uses the same **major** version of Drupal 8.x.

## Varbase Supported Versions

Varbase supports one major version. That is the most recent one using the most recent Drupal 8/9 major version \(_e.g. `8.9.x` , `9.2.x`_\).

Once the most recent stable version of Drupal 9 is released \(_e.g. `9.3.x`_\), Varbase will release its _`9.0.x`_ version and drop support of oldest supported version \(_e.g. `8.8.x`_\).

Upgrade paths will always be provided to guarantee a smooth move between Varbase versions.
