# Varbase Sub Profile Generator

We do have a generator for new Varbase sub profiles, which could help you in a quick way.

## Step \#1

Download the Varbase Sub profile generator from [https://bitbucket.org/Vardot/varbase-subprofile-generator](https://bitbucket.org/Vardot/varbase-subprofile-generator) and get ready to generate profiles.

**For Example:** if /var/www/html/products is your products working directory you could do the following

```text
mkdir /var/www/html/products
cd /var/www/html/products
git clone git@bitbucket.org:Vardot/varbase-subprofile-generator.git
cd /var/www/html/products/varbase-subprofile-generator
```

## Step \#2

Set the version of the generator

**For Example:** if you want to generate a sub profile to use Varbase 8.4.08 you could do the following:

```text
cd /var/www/html/products/varbase-subprofile-generator
git checkout 8.4.10
```

## Step \#3

Run the generate command:

**For Example:** If we want to create a new Varbase sub profile named **cv** , we could run the following commands in your local terminal:

```text
cd /var/www/html/products/varbase-subprofile-generator
bash create-new-varbase-subprofile.sh "cv" -vvv
```

After that you will have a new **cv** sub p**rofile cv-project** as you can see in the following:

```text
cd /var/www/html/products/varbase-subprofile-generator
ll
create-new-varbase-subprofile.sh
cv/
cv-project/
.git/
README.md
settings.yml
varbase_subprofile_basic/
varbase-subprofile-basic-project/
```

## Step \#4

Copy your Varbase sub profile to your working directory.

**For Example:** You could copy **cv** and **cv-project** to your local products development working directory:

```text
mv /var/www/html/products/varbase-subprofile-generator/cv /var/www/html/products/cv
mv /var/www/html/products/varbase-subprofile-generator/cv-project /var/www/html/products/cv-project
```

## Step \#5

You will need to create 2 new **PRIVATE** repositories for your sub profile

**For Example:**

[https://bitbucket.org/Vardot/cv](https://bitbucket.org/Vardot/cv) [https://bitbucket.org/Vardot/cv-project](https://bitbucket.org/Vardot/cv-project)

Then we could add the remote repositories

```text
cd /var/www/html/products/cv
git init
git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:Vardot/cv.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit" .
git push origin master
```

Now we do have our cv sub profile as drupal-profile

And for the cv-project templates

```text
cd /var/www/html/products/cv-project
git init
git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:Vardot/cv-project.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit" .
git push origin master
```

## Step \#6

You will need to have a development working directory to work on changing on your sub profile

**For Example:** If we want to add new features, modules, default content, demo content, and custom theme to our **cv** sub profile we could download the cv-project from [https://bitbucket.org/Vardot/cv-project/downloads/](https://bitbucket.org/Vardot/cv-project/downloads/) or clone it.

```text
 mkdir /var/www/html/dev
 cd /var/www/html/dev
 git clone git@bitbucket.org:Vardot/cv-project.git
 cd /var/www/html/dev/cv-project
```

You will need set your needed branches, for example 8.x-1.x, or 8.x-4.x for your cv and cv-project to call then needed branch for development.

After that you could run the composer install command

```text
cd /var/www/html/dev/cv-project
composer install -vvv
```

Now you could head to [http://localhost/dev/cv-project/docroot](http://localhost/dev/cv-project/docroot) and install your sub profile for development.

## Generator Settings

You will notice a **settings.yml** file which will set the default settings for Varbase Sub Profile Generator.

```text
version: "8.4.08"
dev_version: "dev-master"
default:
  subprofile_name: "varbase_subprofile_basic"
processor:
  private_bitbucket: true
  public_bitbucket: false
  private_github: false
  public_github: false
  public_drupal: false
```

For Development you may need to change the **dev\_version** to and set it to **dev-master**.
