### I have Varbase 8.4.x, how can I start using Media in core instead of the contributed Media modules?

You'll need to update your site in two steps. 

1. Update to Varbase 8.4.29, then run `drush updb` to migrate your media entities to the core Media.
2. After first steps is successful, update to the most recent version of Varbase.

Alternatively, you can use the [varbase-updater](https://github.com/Vardot/varbase-updater) project which guides you through this process in a wizard. See the link below:
