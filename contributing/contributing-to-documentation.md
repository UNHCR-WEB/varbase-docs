# Contributing to Documentation

## Screenshots Guidelines

* Take screenshots from the latest version of Varbase.
* For consistency use this screen resolution when taking a screenshot: 1366 x 768.
* Use [Awesomescreenshot](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com) to help you out.
  * Only use the visible part option, no need to take the whole page, and crop it.
  *   Use annotations (Arrows, Steps numbers, Highlights, Rectangles ...etc.) to annotate the screenshot. Always use the red color.

* Make sure screenshots are displayed in a good resolution, not pixilated.
* Always add a caption to screenshots or images in the documentation page. Captions must be following APA title case style. Use [capitalizemytitle.com](https://capitalizemytitle.com) for help.
* Take screenshots from real content on Varbase website and not from other sites.

## Writing Style

### Naming Standards and Capitalization

* Always capitalize the word Varbase when mentioning it.
* Use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) to check on proper grammar and punctuation.&#x20;
* All titles (H1, H2, H3) must use APA title case style. Use [capitalizemytitle.com](https://capitalizemytitle.com) for help.
* All modules and component names must use APA title case style.\


### Text Styling

* Whenever a module or component name is mentioned, it should be **bold**. \
  Example: Varbase uses the **Layout Builder** module.\

* Divide each documentation page with hierarchical titles starting with H1, then H2, then H3. This will reflect in the "CONTENTS" side bar.\

* When explaining a path to the user, use bold trail of links separated by backslash (\\) making the last item (where the user should land) in italics.\
  Example: Navigate to **Administration** \ **Configuration** \ **Search and metadata** \ _**Metatag.**_\
  _****_
* When a line of code or command is needed, highlight the text and use **<> **option from the tooltip. \
  Example: `cd /path/to/webserver_directory`  \

* To make your documentation nice to read, you can add blocks of hints and notes with nice icons by clicking on it, then change it to the desired one. \
