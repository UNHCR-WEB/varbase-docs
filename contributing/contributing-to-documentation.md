# Contributing to Documentation

## Screenshots Guidelines



## Writing Style

### Naming Standards and Capitalization

* Always capitalize the Varbase when mentioning it.
* Use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check on proper grammar and punctuation. 
* All titles \(H1, H2, H3\) must use APA title case style. Use [capitalizemytitle.com](https://capitalizemytitle.com/) for help.
* All modules and component names must use APA title case style.

### Text Styling

* Whenever a module or component name is mentioned, it should be **bold**.  Example: Varbase uses the **Layout Builder** module. 
* Divide each documentation page with hierarchical titles starting with H1, then H2, then H3. This will reflect in the "CONTENTS" side bar. 
* When explaining a path to the user, use bold trail of links separated by backslack \(\\) making the last item \(where the user should land\) in italics. Example: Navigate to **Administration** \ **Configuration** \ **Search and metadata** \ _**Metatag**_
