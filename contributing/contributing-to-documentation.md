# Contributing to Documentation

## Screenshots Guidelines

* Take your screenshots from the latest version of Varbase.
* Use [Awesomescreenshot](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/) to help you out.
  * Only use the visible part option, no need to take the whole page, and crop it.
* Make sure the screenshots with a good resolution, not pixilated.
* Take screenshots from real content on Varbase website and not from other sites.

## Writing Style

### Naming Standards and Capitalization

* Always capitalize the word Varbase when mentioning it. 
* Use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check on proper grammar and punctuation.  
* All titles \(H1, H2, H3\) must use APA title case style. Use [capitalizemytitle.com](https://capitalizemytitle.com/) for help. 
* All modules and component names must use APA title case style. 

### Text Styling

* Whenever a module or component name is mentioned, it should be **bold**.  Example: Varbase uses the **Layout Builder** module. 
* Divide each documentation page with hierarchical titles starting with H1, then H2, then H3. This will reflect in the "CONTENTS" side bar. 
* When explaining a path to the user, use bold trail of links separated by backslack \(\\) making the last item \(where the user should land\) in italics. Example: Navigate to **Administration** \ **Configuration** \ **Search and metadata** \ _**Metatag.**_
* When a line of code or command is needed, highlight the text and use **&lt;&gt;** option from the tooltip.  Example: `cd /path/to/webserver_directory`  
* To make your documentation nice to read, you can add blocks of hints and notes with nice icons by clicking on it, then change it to the desired one.  Example: 

{% hint style="info" %}
Follow Platform.sh documentation on developing with Drupal 8 and Varbase.  
See [https://docs.platform.sh/frameworks/drupal8/developing-with-drupal.html](https://docs.platform.sh/frameworks/drupal8/developing-with-drupal.html)
{% endhint %}

* You can use from the left options: Image, Table, Quotes, Files, and other nice items.
