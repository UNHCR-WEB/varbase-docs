# Section

## How To Add Section

When we are creating a new section, it is required to choose a specific section layout . Here are some common section layouts: Content Area - Full Width Content Area - Bounded Content Area - Two columns (50/50) Content Area - Three columns (33/33/33)

Section Layouts like “Content Area - Two columns” helps users to divide the section into two (or more) blocks. However, using Section Layouts above limits the user with the number of columns per section. There is another method to put columns in the sections manually, which is to use the block “Columnized Static Content”.

We could also add styling to each section by assigning the section to different CSS Class. In order to add a section to a specific page on the site, follow these steps:

1. Open the desired page e.g.(**Landing Page/Layout builder**)
2. &#x20;Click on the "_**Layout"**_ tab at the top of the page
3. Click on "_**Tasks / Layout**_**"**
4. Click on **“+ **_**ADD SECTION**_**”**
5. Choose a layout for this section _**( Bootstrap One column or Two column or Three column)**_
6. Choose from the "_**Container Types"** options **(Full, Edge to Edge or Boxed)**_
7. _Choose from the **"Gutters"**_ options _**(No Gutters or With Gutters)**_
8. When you finish all the needed updates click on _**“Add Section”**_ button
9. Click on "_**Save Layout"**_ to save the added section.
