# Menu Management

## Menus

Menus are used to navigate a website. Menus are primarily displayed as a hierarchical list of links. Admins on the site can add, remove, and rename menus and sub-menu items/tabs. Note that Admins are advised not to delete any parent links on the site. This will cause all the sub links to not have a parent and become main menu items.
