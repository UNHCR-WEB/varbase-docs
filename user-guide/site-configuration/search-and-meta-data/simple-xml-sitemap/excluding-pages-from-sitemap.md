# Excluding Pages from Sitemap

This section will explain how to exclude a certain page from sitemap.xml.

Please follow these steps below:

1. Navigate to any content for example filter the content page with Basic page
2. Edit a certain basic page
3. Look for “SIMPLE XML SITEMAP” and click the item that can be located in the sidebar \(the node settings\)

![Sitemap section under basic page](../../../../.gitbook/assets/create-basic-page-test-qa-varbase-8-8-x-development-13-07-2020.png)

 3. You will be seeing two options, “Do not index this basic page” or by default, it is selected “Index this Basic page”

![Update sitemap section using this option](../../../../.gitbook/assets/sitemap.png)

4. To exclude this page from being indexed please select “Do not index this Basic page entity in variant Default”

You can apply this setting before creating any content by just visiting the “SIMPLE XML SITEMAP” settings if it is enabled.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some of the content types will be disabled by default like Hero Slider, Testimonials.  In another way, any content type that doesn't have a node page will be not indexed.
{% endhint %}
