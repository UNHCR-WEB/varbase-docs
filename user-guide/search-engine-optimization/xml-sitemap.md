Any public websites need an XML sitemap, it will help in publishing the websites' content and be available on the search engine for example Google. The XML sitemap will describe your content publicly in general if it was news, article, and etc.

* The user can set the sitemap to be generated after cron runs.
* The Sitemap can be styled by displaying it as tables with sortable entries and thus become much friendlier towards human visitors.
* The sitemap can be included/excluded on a certain language, with the removal of the hreflang from the sitemap.
