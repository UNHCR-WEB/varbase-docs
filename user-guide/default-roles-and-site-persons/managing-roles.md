  Varbase utilizes the power of Drupal roles and permissions management. Roles
  are very flexible and can be easily managed and changed to accommodate your
  business scenarios.

# Managing Roles

By default, Varbase offers a set of predefined roles that work for most web content management systems.

{% content-ref url="./" %}
[.](./)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Creating New Roles

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: By default and as a best practice, only the **Super admin role** can add or delete roles.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To create a new role follow these steps:

1. In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _People>Roles._
2. Click _Add role_ to add a custom role.
3. Enter the _Role _name_ _that you want and _save_.
4. Check the new role under the _Roles_ tab.

You can now edit the permissions for this new Role.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Pay attention for the following when creating a new role:\
1- Permissions\
2- Assignable roles as it needs some configurations\
3- Naming convention: Use sentence case for first letters and add spacing between the words.
{% endhint %}
