# Default Roles and Site Persons

Roles enables you to assign specific permissions to a group and to fine-tune the security, use and administration of modules, therefore of Drupal in general. Users assigned to the role or group, are granted those permissions as assigned to the role. Common examples of roles used with which you may be familiar include: anonymous user, authenticated user, moderator, and administrator.

By default, **Drupal 6** automatically defines two roles as a part of site installation:

* **anonymous user** -- readers of the site who either do not have an account or are not logged in.
* **authenticated user** -- the role assigned to new accounts on a Drupal site.

**Drupal 7** creates a third role **Administrator** when you use the _standard_ installation profile. This has all permissions enabled by default. If you want to have an Administrator role using the _Minimal_ installation profile, create a new role and select this as the admin role in admin/config/people/accounts.
