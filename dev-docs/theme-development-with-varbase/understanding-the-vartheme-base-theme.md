# Understanding The Vartheme Base Theme

### Vartheme BS4: Varbase Theme \(Bootstrap 4 - SASS\)

A base theme for [**Varbase**](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase) standard websites.

Based on the [**Bootstrap Barrio**](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap_barrio) theme \(**Bootstrap 4** - SASS\).

**Vartheme BS4** css files structure organized with [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/book/) in mind. Drupal core theme engine is using that as the wight of assets.

**Drupal 9** follows a **SMACSS-style** categorization of its CSS rules:

1. **Base** — CSS reset/normalize plus HTML element styling.
2. **Layout** — macro arrangement of a web page, including any grid systems.
3. **Component** — discrete, reusable UI elements.
4. **State** — styles that deal with client-side changes to components.
5. **Theme** — purely visual styling \(“look-and-feel”\) for a component.
