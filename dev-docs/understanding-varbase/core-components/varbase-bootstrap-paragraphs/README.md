# Varbase Bootstrap Paragraphs

A suite of Paragraph bundles to be used for [Varbase](https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase) distribution.

Made with the Bootstrap framework, based on a fork of Bootstrap Paragraph module [Bootstrap paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap_paragraphs)

Using [paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs), you can add text with a WYSIWYG-editor, pictures, complex layouts to your pages â€“ and change the order by dragging and dropping the content wherever you like it. Thanks to a preview mode, you get a good idea of how your page will look like in the end. It handles responsive layouts in a seamless way.
