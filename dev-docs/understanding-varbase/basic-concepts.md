# Basic Concepts

## A Drupal Distribution

A [software distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_distribution) or \(distro\) is a collection of software components built, assembled, and configured so that it can essentially be used "as is".

[Varbase ](https://www.vardot.com/blog/essential-things-know-about-varbase)is a [Drupal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal) distribution. It packages several adaptive functionalities and essential modules into its powerhouse. It takes advantage of Drupal core modules, as well as other famous and contributed modules and software components.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since Varbase is a Drupal distribution, any Drupal compatible module, theme, library, can be used and utilized with Varbase.

If you're new to Drupal, we recommend you also familiarize yourself with the Drupal docs: [https://www.drupal.org/docs](https://www.drupal.org/docs)

## Packaging Method \(Composer\)

Varbase uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to package dependencies and components. 

To build a project using Varbase, we have provided a Varbase Composer project template.
